# TECHIN 510: Lab 4 - Regular Expressions, Datetime, and Real-time Data Handling

## Overview

This lab focuses on three key programming concepts that are essential for handling and processing data effectively in Python.

- `datetime.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating datetime utilities for managing and manipulating dates and times.
- `regex.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook illustrating the use of regular expressions for pattern matching and data extraction.
- `app.py`: A Streamlit application that acts as a world clock, showing the current time across various global locations.

Each component is designed to provide hands-on experience with these tools, empowering students to tackle real-world data parsing, formatting, and time zone management tasks.

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks, ensure you have Jupyter installed and launch them via your preferred method (command line, Anaconda Navigator, etc.). For the Streamlit app, navigate to the app directory and execute:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
